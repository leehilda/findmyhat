What did you like about this project?
- the kickstart information has been useful. It has given me a skeleton and direction of how the project should go. Unfortunately I am unable to complete the project as brief

What did you struggle with in this project?
The major struggle was the lack of understanding on my end about the various methods especially the high order functions, arrays and objects. Will have to work on that even when the assessment is over.  

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
- We have been using browser API for the past 6 weeks. Perhaps npm can be introduced alittle earlier to get use to the different interface might help a slower learner like me :)
